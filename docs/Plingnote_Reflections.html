We tried to avoid working apart from each other, which turned out to be a wise choice. It didn&rsquo;t just make it possible for us to communicate easier and get a better understanding of what needed to be done - it also forced us to get to know each other better. We don&rsquo;t usually hang out, so working the way we did was essential for the development of the application.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Working simultaneously has, from our experience, been more productive than working individually. Everyone who have tried working from home might have noticed that it&rsquo;s easy to end up doing something completely different than you were supposed to. While you can&rsquo;t force great ideas, we&rsquo;d say that it really helped us to work under the same roof. The biggest advantage was the ability to ask other team members for advices and help. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>One thing that we could&rsquo;ve done better is to have scheduled work hours. Sometimes it felt like we spent too much time working on the SE project instead of, for example, doing math. When working between set times, it&rsquo;s often easier to focus on a specific task. It also makes it possible to schedule other things alongside the SE course. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Since we didn&rsquo;t have any set &ldquo;hours&rdquo; to work between, people could sometimes arrive late to the workplace. It wasn&rsquo;t really a big problem, but it&rsquo;s worth the mention. People who were late usually worked in the evenings instead.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The division of labor was pretty fair. It was clear that some of the members took on the leadership role and spent a little more time on some tasks, but I believe that everyone did a great job in the end. Two of the group members (including me) were really busy the first two weeks and couldn&rsquo;t possibly work as much as the rest of the group. Eventually, we caught up and everything turned out good. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s really important that each team member is doing her/his job, or the whole group might fall behind. Since we met almost every day, it was easy to see if a team member had problems with finishing a task, and could help him/her. In that way we could easily avoid that problem. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0"><a name="h.rbc3kh6sx2su"></a><span>Documents</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>When writing the documents, we used Google Drive throughout the whole project. Google Drive is a free online service where users can store, save and collaborate on documents. It enabled us to work together on each document, in real time, making it easy to spot and correct each others mistakes. Our favorite feature was the ability to add a &ldquo;Table of Contents&rdquo; with one click (provided that each title is formatted correctly). We can&rsquo;t imagine how we would&rsquo;ve managed to write the documents without a service where everyone can edit the document, so that was certainly a great choice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>RAD has been far more useful than the SDD document in this course. We used it a lot when implementing the features and when developing the tests. The SDD hasn&rsquo;t simplified our work in any way. It felt like we wrote it just because we had to, but we understand that it can be useful for other people who wants to understand how our system is designed (or when working on bigger projects). </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the beginning of the course, we spent most time coding on our application. It did cause a little stress later on when we realized that we needed to write more documentation. To alternate between coding and documentation would be the best . Now we had specific &ldquo;code&rdquo; days and some days that we only spent on writing documentation - which isn&rsquo;t exactly fun. It wasn&rsquo;t THAT bad, but we think it would&rsquo;ve become better if we did it another way. Perhaps spending the last hour of each workday updating the documentation would&rsquo;ve been a smarter choice.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s generally good to specify the features of the application before you start working, at least that&rsquo;s how we feel. By writing all the functional requirements in the RAD document, we all knew what the end product should be like. In that way we avoided discussions about how features should be implemented. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We used version control on all of our documents, starting at 0.1. Since Google Drive enables the user to create sub-folders, we created one folder for each release. We believe it&rsquo;s a good way of working, since you can easily find previous versions and compare.</span></p><h1 class="c3 c0"><a name="h.r3057d5a2nsd"></a></h1><h1 class="c3 c0"><a name="h.ql9kqyh5iq0u"></a></h1><h1 class="c0 c3"><a name="h.ynoi1muktqbs"></a></h1><h1 class="c0"><a name="h.7zsbtvbagase"></a><span>SE</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>We used the waterfall approach when developing our application. The group disagreed at first - some wanted to try SCRUM while some wanted to use a more familiar approach - but we came to the conclusion that waterfall would be the best choice for this course. We do believe that this approach isn&rsquo;t really designed for such small projects like this, but we like the idea of designing the system before starting implementing it. In the end, we do not regret our choice.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are some things with SCRUM that we like. We like the idea of being able to distribute tasks to team members on the go, and the way you estimate how long each feature will take to implement seems to be really useful. Using the waterfall approach, however, seems to give the team a better clue of how the finished product should be like.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Using requirements was really helpful when figuring out what we wanted the application to be. Everyone could look into the RAD and easily see what needed to be done, and how it should work. It also helped a lot when writing test specification. Even so, some of the requirements seems so obvious that it actually feels silly to write it down, but we guess it&rsquo;s to make sure that each member of the team wants the same product in the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The majority of our tests were black-box tested using Robotium. Such tests doesn&rsquo;t involve testing of our the written code, it tests the GUI. It was not the best framework we&rsquo;ve tried, because it was really hard to get it to work on different phone models. If you want it to click on a specific image on one phone, it might not click on the same when running the test on another fun. It was really cool to see the automatic tests in action tho!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The development of the application went perfect basically throughout the whole project. Everyone except one person owned an Android, which made it easy to test the features. The emulator in Eclipse was slow, but it worked pretty well. The problem appeared when implementing the map view. From that point, we didn&rsquo;t get the emulator to work. Instead, the person without a phone had to work from a different branch.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The releases became pretty stressful, mostly because we started doing the last changes the day (read </span><span class="c4">night</span><span>) before. Documents needed to be updated and code needed to be fixed and merged to the master branch. Doing this earlier might have reduced the stress (and giving us enough sleep) on the sunday nights. Instead of preparing the release, we spent the previous friday implementing new features. If this was a wise choice or not is hard to tell, but at least it brought us forward in the development of our application.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p></body></html>
